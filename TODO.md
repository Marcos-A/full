# TODO

Concrete next steps. The [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) has the goals, order and reasons. This file only details the current milestone, so tasks for each milestone get added when the one before is nearly done. Delete tasks once they're done and their result is recorded.

## Where things stand

Last updated 11 November 2026.

- **Done:** M1 is live on the website. The M0 spike is finished, and the [audit](docs/desktop/repository-audit.md#m0-spike-results) has its results. M2, the committed shell, is on `main`, with its [results](docs/desktop/repository-audit.md#m2-shell-results) in the audit too. M3, open, is finished, with its [results](docs/desktop/repository-audit.md#m3-open-results) there as well. M4, save, is finished, with its [results](docs/desktop/repository-audit.md#m4-save-results) there too. M5, close, quit and recovery, is finished, with its [results](docs/desktop/repository-audit.md#m5-close-results) there as well. M6, Finder and packaging, is finished, with its [results](docs/desktop/repository-audit.md#m6-finder-and-packaging-results) there too.
- **Next:** M7, public release.

If you're picking this up in a new chat:

1. Read this file, then the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md). The [audit](docs/desktop/repository-audit.md) overrides the [report](docs/desktop/implementation-report.md) where they disagree.
2. Other sessions may be editing `/srv/apps/full` at the same time. Run `git status` first and leave changes you didn't make alone. For anything larger than a small edit, work in a sibling `git worktree` and rebase onto `origin/main` before merging.

## Decisions

The remaining decision, and when it's needed, is in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md#decisions). M7 needs it before anything else: joining the Apple Developer Program.

## M7 Public release

Builds run on GitHub Actions, in the [Desktop build workflow](.github/workflows/desktop.yml). Until M7, a small private beta can use the ad hoc signed DMG, installed as the README describes.

- [ ] Decide on the Apple Developer Program, then add a Developer ID certificate and the notarization credentials to GitHub's secrets.
- [ ] Sign with Developer ID and the hardened runtime, notarize, and staple the DMG in CI.
- [ ] Install the downloaded DMG on a separate Mac and check that Gatekeeper opens it with no warning.
- [ ] A download link, and the README text the roadmap lists for M7, with screenshots of the Mac app.

## Not desktop

Already open, and tracked in the [README](README.md#tests-and-manual-checks). All of these need a real browser:

- [ ] Overwrite after permission, in Chrome or Edge. Do this one first: M1 moved this code, and so far only tests with stubbed file pickers have covered the move.
- [ ] Drop keeps its handle, in Chrome or Edge.
- [ ] Paste into and from Excel, Google Sheets and Word.
- [ ] The main flow in real Safari.

And one to consider:

- [ ] Add more tests to the `@cross` set. The whole suite passes on WebKit in 2.6 minutes, while the regular run covers only about 42 of its 151 tests. Running it all would catch WebKit regressions before they reach the Mac app.
